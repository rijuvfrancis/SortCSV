# CSVFileSortService

Sorting is made flexible, we can have more than one column in the  csv file for sort pattern ,In case of multicolumn sort pattern , based on the column header passed through command line argument as sort pattern, our program will sort the set of records and give you the desired output.

Resources are loaded by Classloader and is stored in Resources folder, hence the command line arguments i am using is as below.

mycsv.csv b mysorter.csv d

Your resultant output will be below. With a very minimal change in code , we can increase any number of columns in csv file  for sort records and get the entire row sorted out.

3,4,1
2,3,2
1,2,3

Thank you !
